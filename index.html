          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>Declarations contain the CSS property that will be applied and the value for that property (div {property: value})</li>
          <li>An external CSS file must be linked to the HTML file using a "link" element.</li>
          <li>A class attribute allows us to share a CSS rule to any element using a class selector such as ".card"</li>

          <li>"Git Flow" refers to the steps needed to commit, pull, and merge your working branch into the main branch and use git version Control.
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds all changes; this stages any changes you've made to the code</li>
          <li>git commit -m "descriptive comment about changes made"
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls any updated code from the main branch</li>
          <li>git push origin [branch name]</li>
          <li>The rest of the Git Flow happens on github.com</li>
          <li>git checkout main: navigates to the main branch in the terminal</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a group of related data that act as a variable.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements, [for] loops, and functions are ways to change control flow.</li>
          <li>"Commenting out" makes a section of code inactive without deleting it.</li>
          <li>[for] loops contain three statements: 1-indicate the starting point for the loop, 2-name a condition, 3-allow re-iterations.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a certain task. This allows us to define and reuse blocks of code.</li>
          <li>To use a function you must 1-define the function, 2-call the function.</li>
          <li>A function declaration uses the [function] keyword and the name of the function: ex. function makeTea().</li>
          <li>To define a function you must have a function declaration followed by a {code block}</li>
          <li>To call a function enter the function name followed by ().</li>
